The Filewin widget implements a simple file selector. It allows
the traversal of directories, and the selection of files. It sorts
filenames first by seperating directories (marked with a #) from other
files (marked with a +), and then sorts alphabetically within those
groups. 

The Filewin contains three parts, a scrollable list of filenames, a
rescan button, and a cancel button. The management of the list and the
rescan button is done internally, but the cancel button requires an
application supplied callback function. This is to allow applications
to leave the fileselector up at all times if they wish, or to pop it
down on selection of a file or the cancel button.

A rescan function is supplied: 
	void XkwFilewinRescan(Widget w,XtPointer client_data,
			      XtPointer call_data); 
to allow the directory to be rescanned under program control. This is
particularly useful for rescanning the directory each time the widget
is popped up. w should be the Filewin widget, and the other two
parameters are not used.

Apart from the resources available to any PopupShellWidget, this
widget has the following resources:

*)  XkwNcancelCallback
	This is the callback for the cancel button. The callback has
the syntax:
	void cancel_cbk(Widget w,XtPointer client_data,XtPointer call_data)
where w is the cancel button widget, and the other parameters are not
used.

*)  XkwNfileSelectCallback
	This is the callback that will be called when a file has been
selected. Note that in the current implementation, the application is
not called back when a directory is selected, the widget automatically
changes to that directory and presents a new list to the user. The
syntax for the callback is:
	void got_one(Widget w,XtPointer client_data,XtPointer call_data)
where char *fname = (char *)call_data gives you the file name
selected, which includes it's path relative to the startup directory.

*)  XkwNfilenameTester
	This function is optional, but can be used to select only
certain files for display in the list. If it is not supplied, all
files appear in the list. The syntax is:
	flag accept_file(KFileInfo finfo),
and it should return TRUE if the file is to appear, FALSE otherwise.
